# ML_Project /Student Performance Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates various machine learning algorithms and their applications. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning concepts through practical implementation. The project includes data preprocessing, implementation of several machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and visualization of results. The main goal is to create a solid foundation for anyone interested in machine learning by providing clear examples and explanations.



## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implementation of algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate model performance including confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data and model results using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShalinVachheta017/ML_Project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML_Project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the Flask application:
1. Set the environment variable for development mode:
   - For Windows:
     ```cmd
     set FLASK_ENV=development
     ```
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     export FLASK_ENV=development
     ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
